# Ruby Code Style

There is no single preferred or enforced style for Ruby code. Several
community- or privately authored styles guides exist, the most widely
adopted is <a href='https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide'
class='remote' target='_blank'>The Ruby Style Guide</a>.

The popular <a href='http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'
class='remote' target='_blank'>rubocop</a> code analyzer and linter is
by default set to the rules of this guide. Though, the tool is flexible
enought to support any style guide, and it is common to have changed
`.rubocop.yml` included with alternative style guides.
