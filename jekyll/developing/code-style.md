# Ruby Code Style

There is no single preferred or enforced style for Ruby code. Several
community- or privately authored styles guides exist, the most widely
adopted is [The Ruby Style
Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

The popular [rubocop](http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) code
analyzer and linter is by default set to the rules of this guide.
Though, the tool is flexible enought to support any style guide, and it
is common to have changed `.rubocop.yml` included with alternative style
guides.
