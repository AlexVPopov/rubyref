# Matrix

*Part of standard library. You need to `require 'matrix'` before using.*

The `Matrix` class represents a mathematical matrix. It provides methods
for creating matrices, operating on them arithmetically and
algebraically, and determining their mathematical properties such as
trace, rank, inverse, determinant, or eigensystem.

its own right, and also constitutes a row or column of a Matrix.
