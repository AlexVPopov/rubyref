*Part of standard library. You need to `require 'matrix'` before using.*

The `Matrix` class represents a mathematical matrix. It provides methods
for creating matrices, operating on them arithmetically and
algebraically, and determining their mathematical properties such as
trace, rank, inverse, determinant, or eigensystem.
