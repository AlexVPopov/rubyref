# Standard Library

The Ruby Standard Library is a vast collection of classes and modules
that you can require in your code for additional features.

This chapter provides documentation and links to class and module
references for all sub-libraries.

Some notes about chapter's structure:

* Libraries are grouped into logical sections; inside each section
  libraries are listed alphabetically;
* Some libraries that are known to be of least usage or least support,
  are just mentioned briefly in the last section;
* Some libraries documentation is moved to previous part of this
  Reference (Built-in Classes) with attached note that it is a part of
  standard library. For example, Set is documented besides Hash and
  Array, Pathname is documented besides File and Dir, and so on.
* IRB (Ruby interactive console) and RDoc (Ruby documentation tool),
  despite being formally parts of standard library, documented in Tools
  chapter.

For installing and developing third-party libraries, see
[RubyGems](#TODO) chapter.
