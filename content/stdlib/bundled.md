## Bundled Ruby Gems

**Bundled gems** are Ruby Gems (third-party libraries) that are installed by default when Ruby is installed. Unlike standard library, those gems could be updated independently from Ruby itself.

Current list of bundled gems:

* [DidYouMean](https://github.com/yuki24/did_you_mean): "Did you mean?" experience in Ruby
* [MiniTest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest): A test suite with TDD, BDD, mocking and benchmarking
* [Net::Telnet](https://github.com/ruby/net-telnet): Telnet client library for Ruby
* [PowerAssert](https://github.com/k-tsj/power_assert): Power Assert for Ruby.
* [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake): Ruby build program with capabilities similar to make
* [Test::Unit](https://github.com/test-unit/test-unit): A compatibility layer for MiniTest
* [XMLRPC](https://github.com/ruby/xmlrpc): Remote Procedure Call over HTTP support for Ruby
