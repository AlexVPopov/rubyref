# Ruby implementations and versions

The main Ruby implementation is called MRI (Matz's Ruby Implementation) and written in C. Its versions (also considered language versions) follow x.y.z scheme, yet does not follow the "semver" convention. Each next `y` version adds new features, and is typically released on Christmas every year.

Current "big" version, covered by this reference, is **Ruby 2.5**.

Another notable Ruby implementation is [JRuby](http://jruby.org/), targeting Java Virtual Machine. It is mostly MRI-compatible and actively maintained.

See [next chapter](./installation.md) about downloading and installing different versions and implementations of Ruby.
